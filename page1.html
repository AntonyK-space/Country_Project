			<p>The Marshall Islands were first settled around 2,000 years ago by Micronesian navigators and later encountered by European explorers in the 16th century.
				The islands were colonized by Spain, Germany, and Japan before falling under U.S. control after World War II.
				During World War II, the Marshall Islands were occupied by Japan and later by the United States, leading to significant destruction and loss of life.
				The U.S. conducted extensive nuclear testing in the Marshall Islands from 1946 to 1958, causing long-lasting environmental and health impacts on the local population.
				The Marshall Islands gained independence in 1986 and became a sovereign nation known as the Republic of the Marshall Islands, facing contemporary challenges such as climate change and economic development.<p>
